  <div class="section-header"><h2>Registration Lottery</h2></div>
  <p>
    To encourage deeper discussion and interactions, registration for HotOS XX will be limited. We expect at least two authors per accepted paper will receive invitations to attend if desired, and we expect about 50% of the attendees will not be authors. We encourage non-author attendees, especially students and industry practitioners, so our registration process for non-authors will begin with requesting an invitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    To request an invitation to register for HotOS XX, please submit the <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/VLmqF9sXPh">HotOS Registration Lottery form</a>. Please ensure <a href="mailto:hotos25-lottery@lists.uwaterloo.ca">hotos25-lottery@lists.uwaterloo.ca</a> is whitelisted in your email client so that you do not miss your notification email.
  </p>

  <p>
    Successful lottery applicants will receive a link to register for HotOS XX and hotel reservation information with their notification email. If you need a travel visa, please refer to the “Travel Visa Information” section of the <a href="attend.html">Attend tab</a> for next steps after you register. Note that your lottery notification email will not serve as either a <b>visa support letter</b> or a <b>letter of invitation</b> for visa application purposes.
  </p>

  <table class="table">
    <tr><th></th><th>Application Deadline</th><th>Notification</th></tr>
    <tr><td>First round</td><td>Monday, February 3, 2025</td><td>Friday, February 7, 2025</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Second round</td><td>Wednesday, April 2, 2025</td><td>Friday, April 4, 2025</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>We encourage both non-authors and potential author attendees (particularly those needing a travel visa for Canada) to enter the lottery by the first round deadline so that travel arrangements can be made as soon as possible.</p>

  <div class="section-header"><h2>Registration Fees</h2></div>
  <p>Please make sure to register by the early registration deadline of February 3, 2025 for the early bird rate.</p>

  <table class="table">
    <tr><th>Registration Type</th><th>Fee (early)</th><th>Fee (late)</th></tr>
    <tr><td>ACM Member</td><td>$700</td><td>$800</td></tr>

  <div class="section-header"><h2>Student Awards</h2></div>
  <p>Thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, HotOS XX will offer a limited number of awards to assist students attending the workshop. Award recipient contact information will be provided to the organizations sponsoring the scholarships.</p>
  <p>Each award will provide a $500 discount code to cover the ACM student member registration fee for HotOS XX.</p>
  <p>In addition to merit and need, decisions about student travel awards will consider: diversity with respect to gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, physical ability, age, geography, and research area.</p>
  
  <h3>Important Dates</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Application Deadline: Monday, April 7, 2025</li>
  <li>Notification: Friday, April 11, 2025</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Who should apply?</h3>
  <p>Funding is available to students (graduate and undergraduate) from any educational institution in the world. We especially encourage members of all groups underrepresented at HotOS to apply.</p>
  <p>Applicants must have an invitation to register for HotOS to be considered for a student award. </p>
  <p>Applicants must be members of the ACM. See the ACM website for a <a href="https://services.acm.org/public/qj/quickjoin/qj_control.cfm?promo=PWEBTOP&form_type=Student">student membership application</a>. Note that ACM provides significantly reduced rates for students.</p>

  <h3>How to Apply?</h3>
  <p>Applications for student awards require both the student and the student’s advisor to provide some information.</p>

  <p><b>Student:</b> Fill out the HotOS XX <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/2UEvw12rcW">student award application form</a>, including the following supporting materials:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Estimated costs to attend HotOS XX.</li>
  <li>A short position statement that explains the expected benefit of attending HotOS XX. The statement should describe any research the student has done, and list any published papers. This statement should be no longer than 500 words.</li>
  <li>Student's CV.</li>
</ul>

  <p><b>Student's advisor:</b> Complete the HotOS XX <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/U3sWMt81YB">advisor reference form</a>. The form requests a plaintext letter that describes the merit of the student's participation, and any partial support from other sources (e.g., the student's institution) available to cover the costs of the student's attendance at HotOS. Advisors writing letters for multiple students should include an explicit comparison of how each student would benefit from an award. </p>
  
  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>
    <p>Should I wait to register until I hear about the student award?</p>
    <p>In most cases, you should wait to register for HotOS XX until you are notified about the student award. Successful applicants will receive a discount code to cover the registration fees.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>What if I need to register earlier (e.g., to apply for a visitor visa)?</p>
    <p>If you need to register before the award notification date, you will need to pay the registration fee. We will reimburse this cost if you receive the award.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Should I reserve a hotel room before I hear about the award?</p>
    <p>Yes. The hotel reservation deadline is <b>April 7</b>. After this date, all extra rooms in the HotOS 2025 room block will be released back to the hotel for the general use of Banff tourists, of which there are many. It will be very difficult to get a room after April 7. If you do not receive an award and are not able to attend HotOS without one, make sure you <b>cancel your hotel reservation before April 14</b>.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
