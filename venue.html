        <h2>Welcome to Banff!</h2>
      </div>

      <p>The town of Banff has been welcoming
        international visitors for well over a century. In 1883, the discovery
        of natural hot springs bubbling from the base of Sulphur Mountain
        led to the establishment of Canada's very first national park.
        The United Nations further designated this area a "World Heritage Site"
        in 1985.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today,
        Banff National Park offers 6,641 square kilometers (2,564 square miles)
        of spectacular Canadian Rocky Mountain landscape. For visitors,
        bathing in the hot springs is but one of many
        activities offered in Canada's foremost National Park. When you visit
        the Banff/Lake Louise area, you will see why more than 5
        million visitors come each year to experience the glory
        of the Canadian Rockies. Bring your camera, bring your family, and enjoy!
      </p>

      <div class="section-header">
        <h2>Climate and Weather</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Dubbed "Canada's highest town" at 1384 meters (4540 ft) above sea level,
        and nestled in world-famous Banff National Park, the town of Banff
        is home to 7500 year-round residents and over 1 million visitors annually.
      </p>
      <p>
        When coming to Banff for HotOS 2025, please keep in mind Banff's
        higher elevation. Be prepared for a variety of weather conditions,
        including a drier climate and cooler days
        than those to which you are accustomed.
        Evenings can be especially chilly!
      </p>
      <p>
        The average temperatures for mid-May are
        between 5 C (41 F) and 20 C (70 F). Occasional rain showers and
        even light snowfall may happen. While most mountain tops have
        snow year-round, the town of Banff does not.
        Nonetheless, you should always be prepared
        for a surprise change in the weather! Therefore, you may want to bring a
        sweater, warm jacket, gloves, umbrella, and warm footwear, along
        with your usual, casual spring attire.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are planning on long walks or hiking during your stay,
        also bring appropriate footwear: sturdy hiking boots for serious
        hikes or a good pair of running shoes for walking around town.
        Banff is located in the heart of the Rocky Mountain Range and
        as a result many hiking trails in the area are rocky and uneven,
        and possibly wet and icy in May.
        It is also important to keep in mind that for every 200 metres
        of elevation gained, the temperate will drop about 1C.
      </p>

      <div class="section-header">
        <h2>Wildlife</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        Much of Banff National Park is untouched and unspoiled by humans,
        and as a result even the Town of Banff gets several different types of wildlife.
        It is not unusual to see deer and elk wandering around in town.
        Moose, caribou, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, coyotes, and beavers are slightly more
        elusive,
        but you might see one along the highway, near the river, or on a hiking trail.
        Though rare, bears and cougars have occasionally been seen around town as well.
        For bird lovers, many different types of birds can be seen in the
        Banff area including Canada geese, bald eagles, blue jays, gray jays,
        chickadees, nutcrackers, and grouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to remember to keep a respectful distance from
        the wildlife, especially if they (or you!) are with their young.
        Even more important than that, please don't feed them, no matter
        how cute they are! Animal-proof trash receptacles are located
        throughout the townsite, and it is essential that all litter finds
        its way into these to keep the town clean and the wildlife healthy!
      </p>

        <h2>What to do in Banff?</h2>
      </div>

      <p>
        Banff has a wide range of activities available for visitors,
        including dining, shopping, hiking, skiing, and sight-seeing.
        The suggestions below are merely a teaser.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking for <b>food</b>, then Banff has many gastronomical delights
        awaiting you. While you should be quite well fed at HotOS itself, a short
        stroll toward downtown Banff will lead you to lots of choices,
        including high-end gourmet restaurants (steaks, fondues, etc.),
        international cuisine (Chinese, German, Greek, East Indian, Japanese, Mexican, Swiss),
        Canadian fare (steaks, brunches, pancakes, maple syrup),
        budget restaurants (pasta, gyros, fast food),
        and snacks (ice cream, yogurt, popcorn, beaver tails, fudge, candy).
        We will have a list of dining suggestions for you when you arrive on site.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to do some <b>shopping</b>, then Banff Avenue is where you need to be.
        About a 20-minute walk from the hotel, you will find stores with everything:
        art, jewellery, photography, key chains, stuffed animals, sweaters, hoodies,
        toques, gloves, rocks, gems, inukshuks, etc. Many shops offer very similar stuff,
        so make sure to shop around for best prices and selection.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are looking to do some <b>skiing</b>, then you might be in luck.
        While climate change has curtailed the spring skiing season at several resorts,
        there is one, namely <a href="https://www.skibanff.com/"> Sunshine Village</a>,
        that traditionally stays open until the Victoria Day long weekend (May 19 in 2025).
        Check out their Web site to see what their base snow pack is for HotOS week,
        as well as rates and hours of operation.
        They have ski rentals available right on site near their gondola.
        And don't forget your sun screen!
      </p>
      <p>
        The Banff area is spectacular for <b>hiking</b> in the summer. There are
        dozens of hiking trails, ranging from the beginner (i.e., paved paths or boardwalks)
        to the extreme (i.e., scrambling, rock-climbing).
        Check out any hiking guide book for the Canadian Rockies.
        Popular outings include
        Bow Falls Trail,
        Cave and Basin,
        Marsh Loop,
        Fenland Trail,
        Sundance Canyon,
        and Tunnel Mountain Lookout.
        Most of these are within walking distance from the hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <b>sight-seeing</b> activities, your main one will be taking in
        the panorama of the Rockies surrounding you morning, noon, and night.
        But maybe you want a 10-minute ride up the Sulphur Mountain Gondola,
        or a refreshing soak in the Upper Hot Springs. Don't miss seeing the
        Bow Falls, which are within earshot of the hotel. And maybe you want
        to find out what a hoodoo is.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a rental car (or friends who do!), there are many
        other sight-seeing and hiking options nearby, including:
        Vermilion Lakes (Banff),
        Johnston Canyon,
        Grassi Lakes (Canmore),
        Lake Louise,
        Moraine Lake,
        and Athabasca Glacier.
        In short, the Banff area is truly yours to explore!
      </p>
