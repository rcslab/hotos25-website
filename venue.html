  <div class="section-header"><h2>Getting To Banff</h2></div>

<p>The town of Banff is located in Banff National Park, which is about 100 km (60 miles) west of Calgary, Alberta,
        Canada.</p>

<p>The major gateway to Banff is <a href="https://www.yyc.com/">Calgary International Airport (YYC)</a>.
        There are direct flights available from Europe, North America, and
        other international points, and connecting flights from Toronto,
        Montreal, or Vancouver.</p>

<p>From YYC airport, there are several transportation choices to get to
        Banff. Several buses operate from the airport directly to Banff and to
        the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel. As well, all major rental car
        companies are available at the airport.</p>

<div class="section-header"><h2>Air Transportation</h2></div>

<p>
        Many US airlines fly to Calgary including Alaska/Horizon, American Airlines, Continental, Delta, Northwest, and
        United.
</p>
<p>
        Air Canada and/or WestJet have direct flights to Calgary from Amsterdam,
        Beijing, Frankfurt, London, Tokyo, and other international cities.
        There are also several international airlines that fly into
        Toronto, Montreal, or Vancouver, with subsequent connections to Calgary
        (Toronto-Calgary: approx. 4 hrs; Montreal-Calgary: approx. 4 hrs;
        Vancouver-Calgary: approx. 1 hr).
</p>

<div class="section-header"><h2>Bus Transportation</h2></div>

<p>
        Bus service to Banff is available from Calgary International Airport via the
        <a href="http://www.banffairporter.com/">Banff Airporter</a>
        or
        <a href="https://www.banffjaspercollection.com/">Pursuit</a> (formerly
        Brewster Transportation).
        The bus is an economical option if you are planning to stay within the
        Banff townsite throughout your visit. Fares are approximately $80 CDN
        each way, or $160 CDN round trip. Travel time one-way is about 1.5-2
        hours.
</p>

<p>
        There are several daily departures to and from Banff. Most buses provide
        door-to-door service to your hotel, while some operate to/from the bus
        depot in downtown Banff, which is about a 20-minute walk from the
        conference hotel.
        Please check the bus transportation sites above to make your booking,
        while coordinating the bus schedules with
        your incoming/outgoing flights.
</p>

<div class="section-header"><h2>Car Rental</h2></div>

<p>
        If you are planning to explore the Banff and Lake Louise area either before or after HotOS 2025,
        then you will definitely want a rental car. Rental cars are typically $40-80 CDN per day, or $300 CDN per week,
        depending on vehicle type, rental car company, and your membership status with them. The best place to get a
        rental car is at Calgary's YYC airport, but there is also a small supply of cars available from the Hertz
        rental desk in the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel.
        Advance reservations for rental cars are strongly recommended.
        Also, don't forget about the hotel's daily parking fee (about $35 CDN) when making your rental decision.
</p>

<p>The total driving distance from Calgary to Banff is approximately 130
        km (80 miles). From the airport, you should plan for a driving time of
        about 90 minutes.
        The Trans-Canada Highway (Hwy 1) is the main route, taking you directly
        west into the Rockies. It is a scenic multi-lane divided highway. If
        possible, try to plan your driving time for daylight hours so that you
        can appreciate the full splendour of the Rockies. And always watch out
        for wildlife on or near the highway!</p>

<p>If you do not already have a <a href="https://www.banfflakelouise.com/park-pass-purchase">National Park Pass</a>,
        you will have to stop at the Park Entrance Gates (located on the
        highway just after Harvie Heights) to purchase one. Prices range from
        about $11 CDN per day to $150 CDN per year. Payment can be made using
        cash, debit, or credit cards. Park permits can also be purchased online
        or at the park headquarters in the Banff townsite if you later decide to
        extend your visit.</p>


        <div class="section-header"><h2>Driving Directions</h2></div>

<p>If you are driving from Calgary's YYC airport to Banff, here are the basic instructions:</p>

<ul>
        <li>When exiting Calgary International Airport, take Barlow Trail North for a short distance.</li>
        <li> Immediately after crossing the overpass above Airport Road, use
                one of the two rightmost lanes to turn right on the cloverleaf to take
                Airport Road westbound.</li>
        <li> Follow Airport Road for about 1 km, and then use the right lane to take Deerfoot Trail northbound.</li>
        <li> After about 1.5 km on Deerfoot Trail, use the right lane to
                take the Stoney Trail ring road westbound. Follow Stoney Trail for about
                18-20 minutes to get to the western edge of the city of Calgary.</li>
        <li>At the west edge of Calgary, turn right onto 16th Avenue westbound, which then becomes Highway 1 West.</li>
        <li>Follow Highway 1 West for about 1 hour until you have passed the town of Canmore and the village of Harvie
                Heights.</li>
        <li>If you do not already have a valid park pass, you must stop at the
                Banff National Park entrance gates to get one.
                It is illegal to stay overnight in the national park without a valid
                permit. If you have a pass already, use the rightmost lanes to bypass
                the queue of vehicles at the park gates.</li>
        <li>After the park gates, keep following Highway 1 west.</li>
        <li>There are two Banff exits on the Trans-Canada Highway.
                The first exit, called Banff/Lake Minnewanka,
                is the one to use when traveling west to Banff from Calgary.
                The exit is on the right hand side of the highway.
                After taking the exit ramp, turn left to head toward the town of Banff.
                Follow this forested road for several minutes
                as it leads you onto Banff Avenue in the heart of the town of Banff.
                (The second exit, called Banff/Mount Norquay,
                is the one to use if returning to Banff from
                the Lake Louise area, or if you missed the first exit.
                Head into Banff, find Banff Avenue, and turn right toward the river.)
        </li>
        <li>
                Continue along Banff Avenue until you are on a bridge crossing
                the Bow River.
                At the end of the bridge, turn left at the traffic lights, staying
                in the left lane to follow the curving road of Spray Avenue for
                about 1 km. The castle-like hotel will appear ahead on your left.</li>
        <li>
                Valet parking ($50 CDN per day) is available at the main hotel entrance.
                Self-parking ($35 CDN per day) is available in the parkade
                just past the hotel, after the statue and roundabout (traffic circle).
                Feel free to drop off your luggage at the main hotel entrance
                prior to parking.
        </li>
</ul>

<div class="section-header"><h2>Welcome to Banff!</h2></div>

<p>The town of Banff has been welcoming
        international visitors for well over a century. In 1883, the discovery
        of natural hot springs bubbling from the base of Sulphur Mountain
        led to the establishment of Canada's very first national park.
        The United Nations further designated this area a "World Heritage Site"
        in 1985.
</p>
<p>
        Today,
        Banff National Park offers 6,641 square kilometers (2,564 square miles)
        of spectacular Canadian Rocky Mountain landscape. For visitors,
        bathing in the hot springs is but one of many
        activities offered in Canada's foremost National Park. When you visit
        the Banff/Lake Louise area, you will see why more than 5
        million visitors come each year to experience the glory
        of the Canadian Rockies. Bring your camera, bring your family, and enjoy!
</p>

<div class="section-header"><h2>Climate and Weather</h2></div>
<p>
        Dubbed "Canada's highest town" at 1384 meters (4540 ft) above sea level,
        and nestled in world-famous Banff National Park, the town of Banff
        is home to 7500 year-round residents and over 1 million visitors annually.
</p>
<p>
        When coming to Banff for HotOS 2025, please keep in mind Banff's
        higher elevation. Be prepared for a variety of weather conditions,
        including a drier climate and cooler days
        than those to which you are accustomed.
        Evenings can be especially chilly!
</p>
<p>
        The average temperatures for mid-May are
        between 5 C (41 F) and 20 C (70 F). Occasional rain showers and
        even light snowfall may happen. While most mountain tops have
        snow year-round, the town of Banff does not.
        Nonetheless, you should always be prepared
        for a surprise change in the weather! Therefore, you may want to bring a
        sweater, warm jacket, gloves, umbrella, and warm footwear, along
        with your usual, casual spring attire.
</p>
<p>
        If you are planning on long walks or hiking during your stay,
        also bring appropriate footwear: sturdy hiking boots for serious
        hikes or a good pair of running shoes for walking around town.
        Banff is located in the heart of the Rocky Mountain Range and
        as a result many hiking trails in the area are rocky and uneven,
        and possibly wet and icy in May.
        It is also important to keep in mind that for every 200 metres
        of elevation gained, the temperate will drop about 1C.
</p>

<div class="section-header"><h2>Wildlife</h2></div>
<p>
        Much of Banff National Park is untouched and unspoiled by humans,
        and as a result even the Town of Banff gets several different types of wildlife.
        It is not unusual to see deer and elk wandering around in town.
        Moose, caribou, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, coyotes, and beavers are slightly more elusive,
        but you might see one along the highway, near the river, or on a hiking trail.
        Though rare, bears and cougars have occasionally been seen around town as well.
        For bird lovers, many different types of birds can be seen in the
        Banff area including Canada geese, bald eagles, blue jays, gray jays,
        chickadees, nutcrackers, and grouse.
</p>
<p>
        It is important to remember to keep a respectful distance from
        the wildlife, especially if they (or you!) are with their young.
        Even more important than that, please don't feed them, no matter
        how cute they are! Animal-proof trash receptacles are located
        throughout the townsite, and it is essential that all litter finds
        its way into these to keep the town clean and the wildlife healthy!
</p>

<div class="section-header"><h2>What to Do in Banff?</h2></div>

<p>
        Banff has a wide range of activities available for visitors,
        including dining, shopping, hiking, skiing, and sight-seeing.
        The suggestions below are merely a teaser.
</p>
<p>
        If you are looking for <b>food</b>, then Banff has many gastronomical delights
        awaiting you. While you should be quite well fed at HotOS itself, a short
        stroll toward downtown Banff will lead you to lots of choices,
        including high-end gourmet restaurants (steaks, fondues, etc.),
        international cuisine (Chinese, German, Greek, East Indian, Japanese, Mexican, Swiss),
        Canadian fare (steaks, brunches, pancakes, maple syrup),
        budget restaurants (pasta, gyros, fast food),
        and snacks (ice cream, yogurt, popcorn, beaver tails, fudge, candy).
        We will have a list of dining suggestions for you when you arrive on site.
</p>
<p>
        If you need to do some <b>shopping</b>, then Banff Avenue is where you need to be.
        About a 20-minute walk from the hotel, you will find stores with everything:
        art, jewellery, photography, key chains, stuffed animals, sweaters, hoodies,
        toques, gloves, rocks, gems, inukshuks, etc. Many shops offer very similar stuff,
        so make sure to shop around for best prices and selection.
</p>
<p>
        If you are looking to do some <b>skiing</b>, then you might be in luck.
        While climate change has curtailed the spring skiing season at several resorts,
        there is one, namely <a href="https://www.skibanff.com/"> Sunshine Village</a>,
        that traditionally stays open until the Victoria Day long weekend (May 19 in 2025).
        Check out their Web site to see what their base snow pack is for HotOS week,
        as well as rates and hours of operation.
        They have ski rentals available right on site near their gondola.
        And don't forget your sun screen!
</p>
<p>
        The Banff area is spectacular for <b>hiking</b> in the summer. There are
        dozens of hiking trails, ranging from the beginner (i.e., paved paths or boardwalks)
        to the extreme (i.e., scrambling, rock-climbing).
        Check out any hiking guide book for the Canadian Rockies.
        Popular outings include
        Bow Falls Trail,
        Cave and Basin,
        Marsh Loop,
        Fenland Trail,
        Sundance Canyon,
        and Tunnel Mountain Lookout.
        Most of these are within walking distance from the hotel.
</p>
<p>
        For <b>sight-seeing</b> activities, your main one will be taking in
        the panorama of the Rockies surrounding you morning, noon, and night.
        But maybe you want a 10-minute ride up the Sulphur Mountain Gondola,
        or a refreshing soak in the Upper Hot Springs. Don't miss seeing the
        Bow Falls, which are within earshot of the hotel. And maybe you want
        to find out what a hoodoo is.
</p>
<p>
        If you have a rental car (or friends who do!), there are many
        other sight-seeing and hiking options nearby, including:
        Vermilion Lakes (Banff),
        Johnston Canyon,
        Grassi Lakes (Canmore),
        Lake Louise,
        Moraine Lake,
        and Athabasca Glacier.
        In short, the Banff area is truly yours to explore!
</p>
