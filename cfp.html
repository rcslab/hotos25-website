  <p>The 20th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems hopes to bring together
    researchers and practitioners in computer systems to engage in a lively discussion on the principles and
    practices of building systems software. Continuing the HotOS tradition, participants will present new ideas
    and debate future research agendas in systems research.</p>
<p>We solicit position papers that propose new directions of systems research, advocate
    innovative approaches to long-standing problems, or report on deep insights gained from experience with
    real-world systems. We seek early-stage work where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal
    submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry that results in multiple conference papers by
    different authors in related venues, rather than a single follow-on conference paper. The program committee
    will explicitly favor papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion.</p>
<p>HotOS takes a broad view of systems research. This includes operating systems, storage,
    distributed systems, mobile and embedded systems, virtualization, programming languages, networking,
    security, dependability, and manageability, as well as new systems contributions influenced by other fields
    such as hardware design, training and serving machine learning,
    verification, economics, social organization, and biological or other nontraditional computing
    systems.</p>
<p>Research and position paper submissions must be no longer than 5 pages including figures and
    tables, plus as many pages as needed for references. Text should be formatted according to ACM&#39;s
    formatting conventions with 10-point font (two columns, 8.5x11-inch paper, 10-point Times Roman or Libertine
    font on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, 0.75-inch margins, 0.33-inch gutter [column separation]). Paper
    submissions will be double blind. The title and an abstract should
    appear on the first page; authors should not. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their
    submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the
    references or acknowledgments). Pages should be numbered. Figures and tables should not require
    magnification for viewing; they may contain color, but should be legible when printed or displayed in black
    and white. Submissions not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline
    extensions will be granted for reformatting. Please use the<a

    (\documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}).</p>
<p>HotOS XX will also feature panels and events with the aim of inspiring lively discussion and
    research direction-setting independent of any specific work. Panels and events may have many formats, from
    conventional panel discussions to breakouts to games. If you are interested in hosting or proposing an
    event, please submit a 1-page proposal (using the same format as above) describing topic, format, and length
    (up to 90 minutes), plus as many pages as necessary for references and supporting letters from planned
    participants. Unlike papers, panel and event proposals need not be anonymous (i.e., they may be single
    blind). Proposals will be evaluated based on relevance of topic and potential to engage the audience. We
    especially encourage panel topics including but not limited to: industry perspectives on systems research;
    diversity and inclusion in systems research; under-appreciated open source technologies; and hardware trends
    and their implications for the future of systems research.</p>
<p>Research and position papers as well as panel proposals must be received by Thursday January 15,
    AoE. This is a hard deadline. Papers and proposals should be submitted as PDF files via <span

        href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hotos25.hotcrp.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726851695132824&amp;usg=AOvVaw3SrvjPqf9j2_vpsyLZn0NL">the
        web submission form</a>. Please select your submission type on the form (paper
    or proposal).</p>
<p>Revised versions of all accepted papers will be available online to registered
    attendees before the workshop. After the workshop, accepted papers will be made available on the workshop
    site, along with slides of the presentation and in some cases a summary of the discussion.</p>
<p>Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete
    the publishing process for any accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has
    recently committed to collecting ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has
    started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author
    discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name
    normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.</p>
<p>HotOS will be an in-person&nbsp;workshop, and we expect at
    least one author of each accepted paper to present it and participate in the discussion. In extreme cases
    (in particular, if authors are unable to obtain a visa) we may consider alternatives, but please contact the
    chairs if you anticipate any problems attending.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In order to encourage deeper discussion and interactions, registration for HotOS will
    be limited. &nbsp;We expect at least two authors per accepted paper will receive invitations to attend if
    desired. &nbsp;For non-authors, especially students and industry practitioners, there will be a registration
    process to request an invitation (to be announced closer to the event).</p>
<p>Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published
    work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. ACM, like other scientific and technical conferences
    and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See
