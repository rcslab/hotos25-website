  <p>
          All people entering Canada as a business visitor require a <b>valid passport</b>.
          Make sure that the expiration date is at least 6 months beyond your intended travel dates.
          For most US citizens, a passport should be all that is needed to enter Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
          Depending on your nationality and/or the country of origin for your trip,
          you may also require either an <b>electronic travel authorization</b> (eTA)
          or a <b>travel visa</b>. Travelers from about 50 countries are eligible for the eTA,
          while those from other countries need a visa. The fee for an eTA is $7 CAD, with processing times
          that range from 5 minutes to 72 hours. The fee for a travel visa is $100 CAD,
          with processing times that typically range from 30-90 days. In some cases, biometrics
          (photo and fingerprints, about $85 CAD) must also be submitted as part of the application process,
          adding further delays. Please plan accordingly, and apply early, particularly
          if this is your first-ever trip to Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
          Since the requirements differ by country,
          please check Canada's
          <a
                  href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/about-visitor-visa.html">IRCC</a>
          (Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada)
          Web site for the latest requirements.
          Further information about travel document requirements and visa processing times
          can be obtained from the Canadian Embassy in your country or from the nearest Canadian Consulate.
          Note that we have pre-registered ACM HotOS 2025 with the special events unit of IRCC to help
          facilitate visa processing for the conference.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  If you require a <b>visa support letter</b> for your application, you can
  <a href="https://supportletters.acm.org/">
          request one</a> from ACM.
  Please do so by <b>March 1, 2025</b> if at all possible.
  These support letter requests are usually handled within <b>two weeks</b>.
  Please make sure that you have registered in advance for HotOS,
  so that the ACM letter can provide confirmation of your registration.
  <p>
          If in addition you require a <b>letter of invitation</b> for your travel
          visa application, you can request one from the Local Arrangements Chair(s)
          at the University of Calgary.
          Again, make sure that you have already registered for HotOS 2025, and send your
          request as soon as possible, and no later than <b>March 1, 2025</b>.
          Your request will be handled promptly, usually within a few business days.
          We will follow up with you to get your personal/travel details so that we can
          customize your letter, and include the special conference code assigned
          to our event by the IRCC.
  </p>
  <p>
          If you have other family members traveling with you, please make sure that
          they have proper travel documents as well. This is especially important if
          any of them are minors (children under the age of 18 years old).
  </p>
  <p>
          Note that the Canadian government does not pay for hospital or medical services for international visitors.
          Please ensure you have the appropriate <b>travel/medical insurance</b> for yourself in case of an emergency
          while in Canada.
