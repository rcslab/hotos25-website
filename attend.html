<p>
        ACM HotOS 2025 will be held at the fabulous
        <a href="https://www.fairmont.com/banffsprings/">
                Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel</a>.
        The hotel is located in the resort town of Banff,
        in the heart of Banff National Park.
        This elegant historic hotel is
        nestled spectacularly in the mountains,
        overlooking Bow Falls and the Bow River Valley.
        Spectacular views of Cascade Mountain, Mount Rundle, Sulphur Mountain,
        or the Bow River Valley are available from many of the rooms.
        The hotel offers many amenities that will make your
        stay special, including unique shops, delightful restaurants,
        a fitness room, a warm outdoor swimming pool, and the Willow Stream Spa.
        The hotel is a 20-25 minute walk from
        Banff Avenue and the rest of downtown Banff,
        with its many
        other hotels,
        unique shops, and
        diverse dining experiences.
        All HotOS sessions
        will be held at the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel
        so there are lots of reasons to stay there!
</p>

<p>
        Hotel rooms are at a premium in Banff in the summer,
        both in price and availability.
        The workshop organizers have negotiated a special guest room rate
        of <b> $459 CDN </b> per night (single or double occupancy),
        plus taxes and fees.
        This room rate is approximately 40% off the regular summer rates for 2025.
        In addition, there is a mandatory <b>Group Surcharge</b> of $16 CDN per person per day,
        which covers porterage, in-room WiFi, fitness centre, business centre,
        PressReader, and select resort activities.
        There are a few guest rooms available with two beds, for which there is a $60 CDN surcharge.
        Pets are also permitted at $50 CDN per day.
        <b>Check-in time is 4:00pm MST</b>. Check-out time is 12 noon.
        The entire hotel is <b>non-smoking</b>.
        There is no provincial sales tax in the Province of Alberta,
        but there are three other taxes that apply:
        a Banff Tourism Improvement Fee (TIF) of 2%,
        an Alberta Tourism Levy (ATL) of 4%,
        and
        a federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 5%.
        These taxes and fees will all appear on your hotel bill.
        Visitors to Canada can apply for a GST rebate when they leave Canada.
</p>

<p>
        Please make your reservation before the <b> hotel deadline: April 7, 2025</b>.
        After this date, all extra rooms in the HotOS 2025 room block will be released
        back to the hotel for the general use of Banff tourists, of which there
        are many. It will be <b>very difficult</b> to get a room after April 7.
        We are not kidding!
</p>

<p>
        Booking information for the HotOS 2025 room block will be available
        here in January 2025.
</p>

  <div class="section-header"><h2>Travel Visa Information</h2></div>

  <p>
          All people entering Canada as a business visitor require a <b>valid passport</b>.
          Make sure that the expiration date is at least 6 months beyond your intended travel dates.
          For most US citizens, a passport should be all that is needed to enter Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
          Depending on your nationality and/or the country of origin for your trip,
          you may also require either an <b>electronic travel authorization</b> (eTA)
          or a <b>travel visa</b>. Travelers from about 50 countries are eligible for the eTA,
          while those from other countries need a visa. The fee for an eTA is $7 CAD, with processing times
          that range from 5 minutes to 72 hours. The fee for a travel visa is $100 CAD,
          with processing times that typically range from 30-90 days. In some cases, biometrics
          (photo and fingerprints, about $85 CAD) must also be submitted as part of the application process,
          adding further delays. Please plan accordingly, and apply early, particularly
          if this is your first-ever trip to Canada.
  </p>
  <p>
          Since the requirements differ by country,
          please check Canada's
          <a
                  href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/about-visitor-visa.html">IRCC</a>
          (Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada)
          Web site for the latest requirements.
          Further information about travel document requirements and visa processing times
          can be obtained from the Canadian Embassy in your country or from the nearest Canadian Consulate.
          Note that we have pre-registered ACM HotOS 2025 with the special events unit of IRCC to help
          facilitate visa processing for the conference.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  If you require a <b>visa support letter</b> for your application, you can
  <a href="https://supportletters.acm.org/">
          request one</a> from ACM.
  Please do so by <b>March 1, 2025</b> if at all possible.
  These support letter requests are usually handled within <b>two weeks</b>.
  Please make sure that you have registered in advance for HotOS,
  so that the ACM letter can provide confirmation of your registration.
  <p>
          If in addition you require a <b>letter of invitation</b> for your travel
          visa application, you can request one from the Local Arrangements Chair(s)
          at the University of Calgary.
          Again, make sure that you have already registered for HotOS 2025, and send your
          request as soon as possible, and no later than <b>March 1, 2025</b>.
          Your request will be handled promptly, usually within a few business days.
          We will follow up with you to get your personal/travel details so that we can
          customize your letter, and include the special conference code assigned
          to our event by the IRCC.
  </p>
  <p>
          If you have other family members traveling with you, please make sure that
          they have proper travel documents as well. This is especially important if
          any of them are minors (children under the age of 18 years old).
  </p>
  <p>
          Note that the Canadian government does not pay for hospital or medical services for international visitors.
          Please ensure you have the appropriate <b>travel/medical insurance</b> for yourself in case of an emergency
          while in Canada.
